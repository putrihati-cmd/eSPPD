## 🎓 Learning Path for Next Developer

### If Starting Fresh:

**Day 1**: Read PROJECT_COMPLETE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md
**Day 2**: Explore codebase using outline as map
**Day 3**: Login and test system manually
**Day 4**: Study ApprovalService.php and RbacService.php
**Day 5**: Run tests and understand test patterns
**Day 6**: Create a simple feature
**Day 7**: Deploy and monitor

### Knowledge Dependencies (in order):

1. **Authentication** (must know first)
   → Enables understanding of session-based access

2. **RBAC System** (second priority)
   → Required for all authorization checks

3. **Database Schema** (third)
   → Foundation for understanding models

4. **Services** (fourth)
   → Business logic implementation

5. **Controllers** (fifth)
   → Request handling

6. **Views** (last)
   → User-facing representation
